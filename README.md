## ðŸ‘‹ hello

**maestro** is a tool designed to streamline and accelerate the fine-tuning process for 
multimodal models. It provides ready-to-use recipes for fine-tuning popular 
vision-language models (VLMs) such as **Florence-2**, **PaliGemma**, and 
**Phi-3.5 Vision** on downstream vision-language tasks.

## ðŸ’» install

Pip install the supervision package in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install maestro
```

## ðŸš€ example

Documentation and Florence-2 fine-tuning examples for object detection and VQA coming 
soon.

## ðŸš§ roadmap

- [ ] Release a CLI for predefined fine-tuning recipes.
- [ ] Multi-GPU fine-tuning support.
- [ ] Allow multi-dataset fine-tuning and support multiple tasks at the same time.
