## Object Detection

Object Detection is a computer vision task where the model is trained to identify and locate multiple objects within an image. In the context of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), this task is often integrated with natural language processing capabilities. VLMs can not only detect objects but also describe their locations, relationships, and attributes using natural language. This allows for more nuanced and context-aware object detection, where the model can respond to specific queries about objects in the image.

## Visual Question Answering (VQA)

Visual Question Answering is a complex task that combines computer vision and natural language processing. In VQA, the model is presented with an image and a question about that image in natural language. The task is to generate an accurate answer to the question based on the visual content. VLMs excel at this task as they can understand both the visual elements of the image and the nuances of the question, allowing them to provide detailed and context-aware answers. This capability demonstrates the model's ability to reason about visual information in response to linguistic prompts.

## Object Character Recognition (OCR)

Object Character Recognition, often referred to as Optical Character Recognition, is the task of detecting and recognizing text within images. In the context of VLMs, OCR capabilities are often enhanced beyond simple text extraction. These models can not only identify and transcribe text from various sources (like signs, documents, or natural scenes) but also understand the context of the text within the image. VLMs can answer questions about the text, translate it, or use it as part of a larger visual understanding task. This integration of OCR with broader visual and linguistic understanding makes VLMs particularly powerful for tasks involving text in visual contexts.
